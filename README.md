# Train-Game
This is a project I am working on to improve my web development, game design and JS. I am currently in the process of improving the UI, and the game controls. I am also changing some of the game functions.

I was inspired from a similar plane game I would play called Fly Corp: Airline Manager. 

Currently, my game has a very basic UI I made using CSS and HTML. I am, however, changing this using Javascript's Phaser library.
